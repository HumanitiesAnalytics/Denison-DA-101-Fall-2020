# Instructions for Peer Review of Final Project Rough Drafts

Share your Final Project Rough Draft materials (RMD, HTML, data) with your partner if you haven't done so already. Read your partner's work in full before beginning your responses. (The best way is probably to download the HTML and open it in a web browser.) Next, create a Google Drive document in your DA 101 folder name it 'Final Project Rough Draft Peer Review'. Use this document for all responses to the questions below. Put your name and your partner's name in the document.

1. Comment on the project's focus, as well as the central research question. Provide suggestions for making it clearer and/or more appropriate for computational, data-driven analysis. 

2. Respond to your partner's description of their central data set. Are the data are fully described, properly sourced, and presented in appropriate ways? 

3. Comment on the project's use of visual materials. Are visuals used effectively to describe multiple aspects of the research project (data, methods, results)? Are their visualization types that could be added to improve the project?

4. Describe your partner's use of data analysis methods. Make some suggestions about how your partner could (a) validate the methods, (b) better describe the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used, or (c) cite outside sources to justify how the methods are being used and interpreted. 

5. Respond to your partner's interpretation of results. Do the results clearly address the project's research question?  

6. How might you partner's project better address the ethical considerations of using the data and methods, as well as the implications of communicating the findings?
