Create a Google Drive document in your DA 101 folder name it 'Topic exploration peer review'. Use this document for all responses to the questions below. 

1. Without your partner’s help, identify what you think is the primary research question. Copy/paste your partner's research question into your Google Drive response document.

2. Without your partner’s help, identify the primary data set that your partner will be focusing on. Based only on what your partner has said about the data set, describe below. Include as much information as you can about its file format and its variables, observations, and values.  

3. Ask your partner if you were correct in your selection from question 1 (research question). If so, how could your partner improve their research question? (specificity, clarity, opportunity for an edifying result, etc.)  If you did not correctly identify the research question, how could your partner clarify what their research question is and/or improve it? Write your responses below. 

4. Ask your partner if you were correct in your description from question 2 (the data set). Provide some written suggestions for your partner in terms of (1) data set selection, (2) describing that data set in greater detail and (3) how this data set or another might be analyzed to address your partner's research question. 

5. Lastly, take a step back. Give your partner some feedback on how to start planning a project based on the ideas they have written about. This can include ideas for things to research, data analysis methods that might related to the research question, data visualization ideas, or anything else that comes to mind. You can use this space ask critical questions, give specific suggestions, or make connections to things we've done so far in class. 

When you have finished writing out all responses, share the Google Drive document with your partner. (If you have placed it in your DA 101 folder, it's already shared with me.
