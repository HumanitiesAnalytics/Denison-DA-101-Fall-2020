# DA 101 Final Project Assignment

## Fall 2020

## Assignment Description

The purpose of the final project is to combine the core skills you have gained in the class in an application of the data cycle producing a short polished report on a question of your choosing, ideally something that you’re passionate about or is relevant to your life or interests (some suggestions are offered toward the end). The final project is divided into four components, each due during a different quarter of the semester. Each assignment is worth 25% of the assignment grade, and the final project as a whole is worth 25% of your grade for the course.

This final project will incorporate all of the steps involved in the data cycle depicted to the right. You will be in charge of stating an interesting question that doesn’t duplicate previous projects/labs, conducting exploratory analyses using skills from the entire semester, building a model that you will interpret, then communicating your key findings in a polished, professional narrative. 

Remember that the data cycle is an iterative, not linear, process. You may find that your original question must be revised to match the available data or that your data will need restructuring to match the question effectively. Further, your first prediction/explanation model might not be your final model. Consider revising the model to solidify your ability to interpret a clear finding. 

Your project must analyze a real-world data set, using the course concepts and materials. You should choose a topic and data set that interests you, and come up with a main question and hypothesis that is answerable. The goal of the project includes demonstrating the breadth of techniques we learned as part of the data analytics cycle this semester: from data cleaning, visualization, summary stats, hypothesis testing, regression, and interpretation. 

Lastly, the final project will be an opportunity to practice your communication with non-technical collaborators / audience, which is a core concern in data analytics generally, as well as Denison's data analytics major. 

Consistent work and progress on your final projects, once the topic is chosen, will ensure a strong end to the semester. Lab time in our final weeks will be set aside for "project sprints," but it is your responsibility to make use of this time. You will still need to work on the project outside of class time to complete it to a high standard. You will receive feedback from your instructor at each of the final project stages.

__Note:__ Do not include raw computer output in your writing: Readability is a major component of reports, so use headings, tables, figure captions, etc. to make it easy to follow.

## Part I: Topic Exploration Component (25% of assignment grade)

In this component, you will write a brief (2 paragraphs + footnotes and a works cited page) research proposal. In this document, you will need to do enough research to articulate an area of interest, describe some scholarly sources related to that topic, and articulate a research question of your own in the topic area you have chosen. You will also discuss how you plan to answer your research question by dividing your question into a set of smaller, more manageable questions, and by naming a publicly available data set that you will use to address your research question. The data sets available include those that you are already familiar with and several more, and they represent the key areas in which you may choose to focus when doing a Data Analytics major: 

- Anthropology and Sociology
- Biology
- Economics/Business
- Physics
- Political Science
- Psychology
- Philosophy
- Sports Analytics
- Humanities (e.g., history, literature, linguistics)
- Design your own domain area!

### On Choosing a Research Question

For this assignment, you can ask questions that are closed (yes or no answer; are the two things different or not?) or open (require more thought and explanation; how much does something change? How is it related to something else?). Likewise, our data analyses can serve one or more purposes as we move through the data analysis cycle: descriptive (describes different measures of the data), exploratory (looking for patterns or unknown relationships in the data); inferential (using a sample to tell us something about a larger population); predictive (use relationships in the current/past data to predict the future); or causal (what happens to one variable when one or more other variables change?). Mostly, choose something that you are curious about and will allow you demonstrate the listed concepts for the project. Have some fun with it!

## Part II: Project Plan Component (25% of assignment grade)

In this component (2-3 pages single spaced), you will turn in a revised introduction, a draft discussion of your focal data set and analytical methods/model (2 paragraphs), and an annotated bibliography of 3-4 secondary sources on your topic and/or methods. 
 
Your description of the data should address key metadata items such as: Who collected it? For what purpose? When was the data collected? Who owns the data? What are the key/interesting variables in the data set? How precise is the data? What kind of a sample does it represent? 

Your discussion of your analytical methods/model should describe the variables you will be focusing on, and what the method you are using assumes or tests for. The variables included in your model are open for you to determine, as is the interpretation of the model.

For your annotated bibliography, follow the format of listing a source citation and then, on a new line, providing a description of that source. Each description should be 4 or 5 sentences long. It should briefly summarize the source and conclude with a sentence about how the source relates to your topic. 

__Note__: At this stage, I also expect you to have a tentative project title. Your title should be original and specific to your focus.

## Part III: Visualization Component (25% of assignment grade)

In this assignment component, you will turn in five data visualizations with titles and descriptive captions. The visualizations must be based on your data set, but you are welcome to use other data sets as a basis for any comparative visualizations. For this assignment component, you should attempt to build on or complicate discussion of variables in the data set from the prior assignment. 

All data design choices are up to you, but you should keep in mind that these visualizations should be aimed at a (mostly) non-technical audience, and should be digestible to anyone with any background. Please observe accessibility norms (such as avoiding color dependency) as well. You should turn in a mix of tables, charts, and graphs, and not multiple versions of the same type of visualization (for example, don't turn in three scatter plots). Keep in mind that your final project report requires two visualizations for the __Data Explanation and Exploration__ section and three visualizations for the __Statistical Analysis and Interpretation__ section, so using this assignment to make progress on those is both allowed and encouraged. 

## Part IV: Written Analysis and Reflection Component (25% of assignment grade)

### Written Analysis 

A knitted and polished rMarkdown file and HTML output reporting the results of your final data analysis project. Roughly, 3-5 written pages maximum. Consider it a "final takeaway" of all the skills you’ve learned in class over the semester. Below is a rough structure of your final written report. Here you should use code folding so this section mirrors a ready to deliver report with clear section headers and interpretations of any statistical or graphical output (like several of our previous projects), but it will also be easy for your instructor to see the code, if needed. Include the following sections in your report:

__Introduction__: 

Provide a two paragraph introduction, professionally written, that gives an overview of the essentials someone needs to know to make sense of the data you show. You must cite and link to your data set somewhere in the introduction (a footnote is OK). Revising and building on your introduction from the previous assignments is allowed and encouraged, but using the exact same introduction is discouraged.

__Ethical Considerations__: 

Provide one paragraph discussing the stakeholders in your data analysis and your ethical concerns or responsibilities using the data and in your analysis. Everyone has ethical considerations, no matter what the data set or subject matter.

__Data Explanation and Exploration__: 

Provide some details describing the data you are working with. What are the observations? The key variables you will be looking at? Are there any particular challenges in the data you will need to work through or be aware of during analysis? 

Provide two polished visuals that describes the data in a way relevant to your question (descriptive, not related to your statistical model specifically--not a scatter plot). Write text that describes the data and what the visuals tell you about your data or decisions you will need to make for the analysis.

__Statistical Analysis and Interpretation__: 

Provide at least two distinct statistical models (for example; multivariate regression and/or t-test) that you interpret correctly and fully in the text. Report your results in a polished table (kable).

Provide at least three polished visuals that specifically support and validate the model(s) you have developed (e.g., residual and regression line/scatter, histogram showing normality of data or residuals, etc.), or help to communicate your main result. Visuals should have captions and be referred to clearly in your text, and they should not all be the same (e.g., not three scatter plots).
Text should fully explain what you show and your findings, to someone who is unfamiliar with your data, code, and models, in terms of the data and in plain language.

__Conclusions__: 

Provide one or two paragraphs concluding about the data: what does it tell us, what are the limitations to this data/model, and what is one future direction you could envision for future data analysts or data collectors?

Find at least one reference that is relevant to or supports your insights, and cite it in this section. You may cite a reference by linking directly to it in your Rmd and/or citing it using your style of choice. Either way, the full citation should also appear in a "Works Cited" page below the conclusions section. 

### Project Reflections

This should be a brief (four paragraphs) look back on the work you have done for this assignment. 
What "rules" did you follow for working with and interpreting the data and statistics?
What do you think was your most effective data visualization ?
